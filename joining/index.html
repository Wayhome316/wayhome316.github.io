<p><b>Graduate Students</b></p>

<p>If you are currently Georgia Tech graduate students, please send the following materials in your email: CV/resume, 
1-2 representative papers/reports/documents that can demonstrate your academic research capabilities, and 2-3 reference 
points of contact. I usually donâ€™t schedule individual meetings unless the lab has an impending demand in specific directions
 or your background matches well.

If you are non-GT students and looking for graduate research positions, please submit your application via the GT graduate 
school system. You can apply for the Georgia Tech Mechanical Engineering or Robotics Ph.D. program with Mechanical Engineering
 as your home department. If you get admitted, please reach out to me early January or February and we can discuss if there is a 
match. A list of Georgia Tech fellowships is here.
