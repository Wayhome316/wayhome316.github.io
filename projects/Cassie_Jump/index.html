	This work aims to push the limits of agility for bipedal robots
	by enabling a torque-controlled bipedal robot to perform robust
	and versatile dynamic jumps in the real world. We present a
	multi-task reinforcement learning framework to train the robot
	to accomplish a large variety of jumping tasks, such as jumping
	to different locations and directions. To improve performance
	on these challenging tasks, we develop a new policy structure
	that encodes the robot's long-term input/output (I/O) history
	while also providing direct access to its short-term I/O
	history. In order to train a versatile multi-task policy, we
	utilize a multi-stage training scheme that includes different
	training stages for different objectives. After multi-stage
	training, the multi-task policy can be directly transferred
	to Cassie, a physical bipedal robot. Training on different
	tasks and exploring more diverse scenarios leads to highly
	robust policies that can exploit the diverse set of learned
	skills to recover from perturbations or poor landings during
	real-world deployment. Such robustness in the proposed
	multi-task policy enables Cassie to succeed in completing a
	variety of challenging jump tasks in the real world, such as
	standing long jumps, jumping onto elevated platforms, and
	multi-axis jumps.
