Are you interested in working on reinforcement learning, computer animation,
and legged robots? I'm currently looking for PhD/MSc students. If you are
interested, please apply through <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/graduate-students/admissions.html">SFU admissions</a>.
You can mention my name in your application, and I will be sure to through them.
Once you have been admitted, feel free to email me with your interests, CV, and transcripts.
